# Introduction: Business Problem 

Vancouver with a population of 2,581,000 and Toronto with a population of 6,197,000 are Canada's two metropolitan cities. Although Vancouver has a population of about less than half of that of Toronto but it is still competing very closely with Toronto in terms of restaurants  and cafes. 

   In this project, I will compare the neighborhood of the two city. This report is specifically targeted a chain restaurant that would like to open a new branch in each city and tries to search to find the best
location and a customized menu for each location. The chain considers 2 factors to decide about the location and the menu as follow: 

   1. The location should be in a popular neighborhood that can attract visitors. 
   2. The menu for each location should includes foods that are less offered by other restaurants in the         that neighborhood.  

# Data 

Based on definition of our problem, factors that will influence our decision are:

1. For the location: 
* Number of existing restaurants and other public venues such as parks, beaches, museums in the neighborhood. 
* Distance of neighborhood from city center. 
2. For the menu:
* The dishes that are less offered by the restaurants in that neighborhood.  

Following data sources will be needed to extract/generate the required information:
* centers of candidate areas will be generated algorithmically and approximate addresses of centers of those areas will be obtained using **Wikipedia**
* number of restaurants and their type and location in every neighborhood will be obtained using **Foursquare API**
* coordinate of Vancouver will be obtained using ** The government of British Columbi's BC Address Geocoder website **.
